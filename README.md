# VehicleCreator

Solution1: First design was created using the concept of Factory Design Pattern. solution1 will found in the solution1.java file.
Factory pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface. 



Solution2: Second design was created using the concept of Decorator Design Pattern. solution2 will found in the solution2.java file.
Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing class.
This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact.

For both solution UnitTest is given(VehicleTest.Java)
